# Subway-Cars

**Language:** JavaScript  
**Technologies:** HTML

## Overview  
Subway-Cars is a browser-based simulation/game where subway cars move along tracks on the screen. This project demonstrates animation using JavaScript, movement logic, object interactions, and dynamic HTML/CSS rendering.

The game simulates subway cars traveling along a line, changing positions over time, and following the rules defined in the code.

## Features  
- Animated movement of subway cars across the screen  
- HTML/CSS layout for track and car visuals  
- JavaScript logic controlling:
  - Position updates  
  - Direction changes  
  - Speed changes  
  - Start/stop behavior  
- Clean, beginner-friendly code structure  
- Runs directly in the browser — no installation required

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srujan57/Subway-Cars.git
Navigate into the project directory:
Open the index.html file in any web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)
The simulation will begin immediately.
No build steps needed — this is a pure HTML/JS project.

What the Code Demonstrates:
-JavaScript animation using setInterval()
-DOM manipulation and screen updates
-Object-like structures for representing subway cars

Logic for:
-Movement
-Updating positions
-Detecting when cars reach the end
-Looping/resetting animation
-Clean separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
-Fundamental game/simulation architecture

Possible Future Improvements:
-Add more tracks or branching lines
-Allow user interaction (e.g., click to change speed)
-Add station stops with timers
-Add collision detection or safety spacing logic
-Add sound effects or smoother animations
-Add support for mobile/touch devices
